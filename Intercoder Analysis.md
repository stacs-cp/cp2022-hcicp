CSV containing data from the intercoder rating session

The headers contain all the possible Visual Elements vs Parts of Problem Language Combinations

The rows are grouped by artifacts (all the pages of problem for a participant).

Each coder is represented by a colour.

1 means that the code combination was selected, 0 means that the code combination was not selected.

The amount of correlation between the control coder and the others are calculated to be number between 0 and 1.

The formula used is: 1-(ABS(SUM(Other coders, Control Coder*-3))/COUNT(Other coders))

The average of correlation is calculated for all the code combinations and is show in the agreement column for each artifact

The average of all the artifacts is calculated and is at the bottom of the agreement column
