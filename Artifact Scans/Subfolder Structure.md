Participant Type -> Numerical Order of Participant -> Numerical Order of Problem Type
The files are named with the Artifact ID, which can be mapped to the Participant ID used in the paper using the *Participant ID Conversion.csv* file

- Participant Type: Either Non-CS (Non Computer Scientists), CS (Computer Scientists) or CP (Constraint Programmers)
  - Which cohort the participant was in
- Numerical Order of Participant: 1 to 10
  - Order which participants attended the experiment
  - **does not** correspond to Participant ID or Artifact ID
- Numerical Order of Problem Type: 1 or 2
  - 1 is the first problem participants attempted
  - 2 is the second problem participants attempted
  - **does not** correspond to Problem Number or Artifact ID
